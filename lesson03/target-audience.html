        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A college student is wondering wether or not to plan a ski trip this weekend. The last ski trip was incredible icy and not fun. Is it going to snow this week and 
                should they plan the trip? </li>
            <li>A small family of four is wanting to go camping this weekend, but they're not sure what the weather will be? What's the liklihood that rain will ruin their camping
                trip?</li>
            <li>Is it a good time to raft the snake river? You want to raft, but also don't want to be burnt to a crisp? What day this week would have the most cloud coverage for 
                your adventure?</li>
            <li>You want to teach your son how to golf, but it's spring and the weather has been unpredictable lately. What's the best day this week to go out?</li>
            <li>You're going out to ride dirt bikes this weekend. The area is really dusty so it'd be nice to go a day or two after it rains. What's the best day to go
                this week?</li>
        </ol>
