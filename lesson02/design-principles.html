            <p>The ESPN homepage does a good job using repetition and proximity to identify each new article within the site.  
               The layout of each article link is repeated throughout the homepage. Each link contains an image or video followed by 
               a brief explanation of the article. Proximity is used to lump the image and video with the proper descritpion. Without
               proximity the images and text would just be floating on their own.

            <p>Hick's Law states that with each additional choice, there is an increase in the time it takes to make a decision.
                Home Depot obviously has tens of thousands of products so it wouldn't be prudent to list all of the products on one
                page. The homepage instead lists out categories that you can choose from to narrow down to what you're looking for. 
                The categories help make it easier for consumers to find what they're looking for an make quicker decisions.

            <p>Best Buy</p>
            <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=nintendo+switch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys">www.bestbuy.com</a>
            <img src="images/best_buy.png" alt="screenshot of bestbuy mobile page">
            <p>Best Buy's site does a good job using Visual Hierarchy to help consumers make purchases. In Best Buy's product list, the two most prominent items are 
                the image of the product and the yellow "Add to Cart" button on the right. The product descriptions are lest prominent, but also provide consumers with useful information. 
                Having the price and the bright yellow button makes it a lot easier to find the call to action than if visual hierarchy wasn't used.
